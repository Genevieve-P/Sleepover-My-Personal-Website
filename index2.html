        <p>Heyo! My name is Gummi, an alias as I've mentioned before. I'm a teenager in high school in the middle of a lot a different interests. Fun fact, I wasn't actually into coding till just a year ago. I started getting into legit coding a year ago, but before that, I thought real coding was just block code like in Scratch. Now though, I'm in the middle of immersing myself into HTML and CSS. Python is where I have an official certification in, but I don't use as often anymore as it is a backend language. I plan on getting into JavaScript more soon, but as of now, enjoy my creation i made out of a great ton of CSS and HTML!</p>

        <p>Besides coding, I have a lot of other interests. I like to crochet a lot and just recently made a humongous jellyfish plushie! I also like to draw digitally as seen through the icon of this website. Video gaming is also really fun and I like to play with my sibling when I can. Other than that, I like to watch anime while doing some of these things. My all-time favorite is My Hero Academia as it is the one that marked the point of no return for me. I like to think up fanfic sometimes and I read a lot of fanfic in my free time as well. I really like cats, Kirby, and Kuromi as well and have a lot of plushies and collectibles for all of them.</p>
